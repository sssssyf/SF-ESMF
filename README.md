# Usage

We provide a demo of the Indian Pines hyperspectral data.
The initial model can be trained by run the file of train.py with the corresponding file of configuration. Besides, we also provide three types of trained model pretrained on different SourceData.  Please note that due to the randomness of the parameter initialization, the experimental results might have slightly different from those reported in the paper. Please refer to the paper for more details.
